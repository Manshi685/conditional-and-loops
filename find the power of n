Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int x,n,i,k;
    cin>>x;
    cin>>n;
    i=1;
    k=1;
    if((0<=x<=8)&&(0<=n<=9)){
            while(i<=n){
                k=k*x;
                i=i+1;
            }

    }
    cout<<k<<endl;

  }
