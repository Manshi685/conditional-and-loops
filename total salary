Write a program to calculate the total salary of a person. The user has to enter the basic salary (an integer) and the grade (an uppercase character), and depending upon which the total salary is calculated as -
    totalSalary = basic + hra + da + allow – pf
where :
hra   = 20% of basic
da    = 50% of basic
allow = 1700 if grade = ‘A’
allow = 1500 if grade = ‘B’
allow = 1300 if grade = ‘C' or any other character
pf    = 11% of basic.
Round off the total salary and then print the integral part only.


#include <iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int ba,al,ts;
    char gr;
    cin>>ba;
    cin>>gr;
    double hr,pf,da;
   if(0<=ba<=7500000){
      hr=0.2*ba;
      da=0.5*ba;
      pf=0.11*ba;
    }
     if(gr=='A'){
        al=1700;
    }else if(gr=='B'){
        al=1500;

    }else{
       al=1300;

    }
    ts=round(ba+hr+da+al-pf);
    cout<<ts<<endl;


  }
